code based on [Behaviour Driven Development with JavaScript - An introduction to BDD with Jasmine](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18916899-behaviour-driven-development-with-javascript---an-introduction-to-bdd-wi).

Instead of [jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine) I use [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape).
